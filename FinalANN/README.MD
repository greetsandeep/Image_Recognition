=================================Artificial Neural Networks=========================================

To run the project, first compile the ArtificialNeuralNetworks.java file by using the command "javac ArtificialNeuralNetworks.java". Then run using the command "java ArtificialNeuralNetworks". The java doc and source code (classes in separate files) is also attached.

Program Execution:

The program executes all three tasks one by one (in the order: sunglasses recognition, pose recognition, face recognition), with a gap of four seconds between each. The three Multi-Layered Perceptrons created are serialized into files and the weights of the internal layers are automatically visualized and written to images. To change the parameters, a simple change in the main function of the java file and recompilation is needed. (See the javadoc for more information about the parameters).
